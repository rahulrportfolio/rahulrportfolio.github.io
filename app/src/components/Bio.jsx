                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Hey there! I'm a <span class="font-semibold">developer</span> passionate about building things that are
                    <span class="font-semibold"> useful, efficient, and easy to use</span>. I work have with
                    <span class="text-blue-500"> Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM)</span> and
                    <span class="text-blue-500"> iOS (SwiftUI, UIKit, iOS SDK)</span>. I also have experience with
                    <span class="text-blue-500"> RESTful APIs, FastAPI, Docker, BASH and Linux</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    I recently completed my <span class="text-green-600">computer science degree</span>, Where I built a strong foundation in core
                    computer science concepts like operating systems, computer architecture, and database systems. Throughout my studies, 
                    I worked on various projects that deepened my understanding of mobile development and operating systems. Now, 
                    I'm focused on applying and expanding my skills in the real world, whether in <strong class="text-purple-600">DevOps</strong>, <strong class="text-purple-600">systems engineering</strong>, <strong class="text-purple-600">data science</strong>,
                    or <strong class="text-purple-600">software development</strong>. I am constantly learning and refining my approach to building reliable software system.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Beyond coding, I'm interested in how <span class="font-semibold">technology can provide personalized solutions
                    in healthcare and finance</span>, whether through <span class="font-semibold">financial education</span> or
                    tailored user experiences. I believe that well-designed applications can make a meaningful impact, and Iâ€™m excited
                    to contribute to that space.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    I love solving problems, staying up to date with new technologies, and continuously improving as a developer. My
                    goal is to keep growing, take on challenging projects, and build solutions that people find truly helpful.
