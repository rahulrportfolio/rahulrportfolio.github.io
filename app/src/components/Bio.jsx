                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Hey there! I'm a <span class="font-semibold">mobile developer</span> passionate about building apps that are
                    <span class="font-semibold"> useful, efficient, and easy to use</span>. I work with
                    <span class="text-blue-500"> Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM)</span> and
                    <span class="text-blue-500"> iOS (SwiftUI, UIKit, iOS SDK)</span>. I also have experience with
                    <span class="text-blue-500"> RESTful APIs, FastAPI, and Docker</span>.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    I recently completed my <span class="font-semibold">computer science degree</span>, where I built a strong
                    foundation in software development, problem-solving, and modern technologies. Throughout my studies, I worked on
                    various projects that deepened my understanding of mobile development and backend systems. Now, I'm focused on
                    applying and expanding my skills in the real world, constantly learning and refining my approach to building great
                    software.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                    Beyond coding, I'm interested in how <span class="font-semibold">technology can provide personalized solutions
                        in healthcare and finance</span>, whether through <span class="font-semibold">financial education</span> or
                    tailored user experiences. I believe that well-designed applications can make a meaningful impact, and Iâ€™m excited
                    to contribute to that space.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    I love solving problems, staying up to date with new technologies, and continuously improving as a developer. My
                    goal is to keep growing, take on challenging projects, and build apps that people find truly helpful.
